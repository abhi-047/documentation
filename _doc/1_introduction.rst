Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project is intended to demonstrate the standard python project work-flow that is being followed at `Computational Mechanics lab <https://computationalmechanics.in/>`_. By presenting the basic folder structure, this project focuses of documentation of source code for easy collaborations. to presenting in a website through Sphinx documentation tool.

To demonstrate the entire workflow, this projects considered simple maths.py file containing two classes that stores two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them. The python code presented is containing properly formatted docstrings, which is mandatory for better representation in final document.

This project has two modules:

* maths
